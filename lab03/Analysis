A - The graph can be observed to have dip voltage between 10-12 and 14-16 with a sudden increase in voltage at 16. 

D - like A but there is only dip. 

This implies that there are two phenomena in effect here

First, there is the periodic dipping and the effect from sudden current increase

If one looking at the apparatus at the sudden peak, one can see the blue radiation from the tube, this is the
characteristic of the plasma state, the explanation for this peak is that the electric field of from the accelerating
voltage is stronger than the binding energy of mercury nucleus and electron and cause the dielectric breakdown of the
Mercury, making it conducting.
